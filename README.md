# SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19
Here we have taken Covid-19 data for the Qatar from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset?select=covid_19_data.csv)

[Codes](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/tree/master/Codes) consists of following files and folders:

  1) [Data](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/tree/master/Codes/Data) folder consists of Kaggle time series data for different Countries.

  2) [Original data](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/tree/master/Codes/Original_Data) folder consists of data from Kaggle which is in       raw(uncleaned) form and we have [Data_Clean.ipynb](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/blob/master/Codes/Data_Clean.ipynb) notebook for cleaning the same.

   3) [Networked_SEIR_Model.ipynb](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/blob/master/Codes/Networked_SEIR_Model.ipynb) file consists code for obtaining data from Network Model.

   4) [SEIR_ODE_lockdown.ipynb](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/blob/master/Codes/SEIR_ODE_lockdown.ipynb) or [SEIR_ODE_lockdown.py](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/blob/master/Codes/SEIR_ODE_lockdown.py) code runs for Lockdown analysis on solution from ODE.
   
[Presentation and Report](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/tree/master/Presentation%20and%20Report) consists of:
   
  1) [Presentation](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/blob/master/Presentation%20and%20Report/Modelling%20the%20spread%20of%20COVID-19.pdf)  Slides for this project.
  
  2) [Report](https://github.com/rodosingh/SEIR-Modelling-of-COVID-19/blob/master/Presentation%20and%20Report/Report_SEIR.pdf) in brief for what we have done.
